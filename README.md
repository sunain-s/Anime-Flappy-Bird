# Flappy-Bird
Anime Flappy Bird  - made in Python using Pygame

A modified flappy bird style game, made to teach myself sprite animation and how to make endless side-scroll games. 
Made based on the following tutorial:

# How to run

Download the files using the green code button and select 'Download Zip'. Run the 'FlappyBird.exe' file as a normal application or if Python and Pygame are installed to your device run 'menu.py'.

**This game is designed for resolutions with height >= 1080p**, make sure your device fits this specification before downloading.

Occasionally replace all data in the 'scores.txt' file with your highscore (e.g. 0;0;1;1;4;5;7;8;2;3;4;5;6;7;8..... ====> 18) in order to maintain progress whilst having a smoother experience further down the line.

# What I learnt

- Functional programming with pygame
- sprite animation
- creating an endless looping game
- game states i.e. active or over
- basic physics (gravity) implementation
- using functions to pass variables between files
- using functions to minimise code length and maximise readability
- editing and looping soundtracks using pygame.mixer
